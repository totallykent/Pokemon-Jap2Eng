# Pokemon-Jap2Eng
This program takes in a subtitle file(.mks) and changes the Romanji names of the Pokemons to it official english names from Generation 1 to 9. This is just to make English viewers less confused on the names when watching Pokemon. This uses FFmpeg to convert ".mks" to ".ssa".

# Examples
Mokuroh --> Rowlet
Gaburias --> Garchomp
